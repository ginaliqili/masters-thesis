## ISD Stations
Dew point data is only available from ASOS and AWOS stations from major and minor airports. For the NOAA API, the global-hourly data uses AWS+WBAN number combination. The va-isd-stations.csv file contains these stations for VA only. List for entire US was given by Stuart Hinson from NOAA and then subset to reflect VA only.

## GHCN Stations
Daily maximum temperature is available from a much large network of GHCN weather stations. The va-ghcn-stations.csv includes the VA GHCN stations only.
